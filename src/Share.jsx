                [insert couple here] later", then never go through with it because it's a pain?</p>
                <p>Well, this is still a pain, but I'm endeavoring to make it at least a little easier!</p>
                <p>There's no shared folders to be invited to, no clouds or drives, just click the button below,
                enter your social security number (kidding), and select the photos you'd like to share.</p>
